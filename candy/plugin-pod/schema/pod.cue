// plugin-pod's OWN self-contained CUE schema — the SINGLE SOURCE for this plugin's
// served declaration surface (there is no schema-less plugin: every plugin ships a
// non-empty schema over Describe).
//
// SELF-CONTAINED and PACKAGE-LESS: it references no base def and carries no package
// clause, so it compiles STANDALONE — the property the SDK's serve-side compile needs
// and the property that lets the host splice `base ++ plugin` at the load gate
// (registerPluginUnitSchema); a self-contained schema that will not splice is a LOUD
// load failure.
//
// NO GO CONSUMER: the plugin declares no typed `plugin_input` (its authored input is
// its pass-through CLI grammar), so this schema generates NO `params` package and has
// NO `cue exp gengotypes` artifact — it is the SERVED documentation/config surface,
// not a code-generation source.
//
// It DOCUMENTS the eleven independent top-level `command:` words this plugin serves.
#PodPlugin: {
	// The independent top-level command words this plugin serves (no shared parent
	// — each command word is its own top-level charly command). A command's args
	// are pass-through CLI tokens (there is no typed plugin_input), so these words
	// ARE this plugin's authored declaration surface.
